Easy Roads

A not so easy game about managing a developing city's road infrastructure. Make sure each house gets to their destination on time or else you'll get fired!

Houses will spawn over time and your job is to build roads and hook them up to the large structures around the map. You earn money when a house reaches it's destination, so the more efficient your roads, the better. The more you play, the more houses and structures spawn in, so be warned that things can get very hectic very quickly!
