Connection Maker (to be changed)

The game will be based on a grid-based building system.
Your job is to hook up your town so that all the citizens needs is met.
At the start of the game, 5 main buildings will spawn somewhere random on the map.
Overtime, houses will spawn in. These houses will request to go to one of the main buildings.
As the game progresses, the houses will level up and want to go to multiple buildings.
To make sure their needs are met, you will have to build roads and infrastructure.
Everytime a request is fulfilled, you earn money to spend on more roads and infrastructure.
If a house goes too long without their needs being met, you lose the game.
This can happen due to the roads getting too clogged, so you need to watch out for traffic.

Polish:
Camera Controls (moving to grid limit)
Make Cars drive out of house instead of spawning ontop of house
Fix Roundabout Navigation Polygon
Fix Car rotation + offset
Add bubble jitter when it gets close to expiring
